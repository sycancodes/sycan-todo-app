# Sycan ToDo - IndexedDB Web App
A ToDo web application that used the the IndexedDB API.


I found a tutorial on how to build this project on **DEV**. It teaches the basics of the IndexedDB API, specifically:

- The concepts of transactions, requests, object stores
- Performorming **CRUD** operations in the IndexedDB instance.


## Features

- **Create a task**: You can create a brand new task with a given title, description and deadline date. Later that task is saved using JavaScript IndexedDB API.
- **Show saved tasks**: Everytime the page loads it will query the indexed database to get all saved tasks and display them as panels at the bottom of the page.
- **Edit a task**: You can edit any given task at any given moment.
- **Toggle the "done" status of a task**: You can toggle whether a task is "done" via either a checkbox or while editing the task.
